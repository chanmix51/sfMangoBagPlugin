SfMangoBagPlugin is a plugin for the symfony PHP framework.

It aims at marrying doctrine objects in a relationnal database with records in a schemaless mongodb database. This has several advantages :
* It makes your Doctrine objects to become extensibles without altering your tables
* fast key:value search
* (will) allow to attach files to Doctrine objets directly

It is still highly experimental and should not be used in production.
